# Rowly: Rowing Workout Tracker

## Project Description

**Purpose and Target Audience:**  
Rowly is aimed to help users track and review their rowing workouts. It allows users to input key workout statistics, such as distance, time, and pace, and organizes them into a personalized workout library. It includes additional features like summary charts, personal best tracking, and streak monitoring to keep rowers motivated. Rowly's target audiene is beginner rowers looking for a simple, straightforward tool to help track and improve their performance over time.

**Why this project is meaningful to me:**  
I joined the UBC rowing team as a novice rower this year and have been looking for a simple rowing workout tracker. However, many existing apps are either not designed for rowing or overwhelm users with extensive data and statistics. My goal is to build a tracker that only encorporates key statistics and includes fun charts and streak tracking that help keep users motivated and support their performance improvement.
