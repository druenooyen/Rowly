# Rowly: Rowing Workout Tracker

## Project Description

**Purpose and Target Audience:**  
Rowly is aimed to help users track and review their rowing workouts. It allows users to input key rowing workout statistics, including date, distance, and time, and organizes them into a personalized workout library. It includes additional features like flagging personal bests, total distance tracking, and streak monitoring to keep rowers motivated. The target audience is beginner rowers looking for a simple, straightforward tool to help track and improve their performance over time.

**Why this project is meaningful to me:**  
I joined the UBC rowing team this year as a novice rower and have been looking for a simple rowing workout tracker. Many existing workout trackers are either not designed for rowing or overwhelm users with extensive data and statistics. My goal is to build a straightforward tracker that only encorporates key statistics and includes fun charts and streak tracking that help keep users motivated and support their performance improvement.
