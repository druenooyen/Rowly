# Rowly: Rowing Workout Tracker

## Project Description

**Purpose and Target Audience:**  
Rowly is aimed to help users track and review their rowing workouts. It allows users to input key rowing workout statistics, including date, distance, and time, and adds them into a personal workout library. It includes additional features like tracking total distance and highlighting personal bests to keep rowers motivated. My target audience is rowers that are new to the sport and are looking for a simple, straightforward tool to help track and improve their performance over time.

**Why this project is meaningful to me:**  
I joined the UBC rowing team as a novice rower in September 2024 and have been looking for a simple rowing workout tracker. Many existing workout trackers are either not designed for rowing or overwhelm users with extensive data and statistics. My goal is to build a straightforward tracker that only encorporates key statistics and includes a few useful data tracking features that help keep users motivated and support their performance improvement.
